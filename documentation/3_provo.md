# Layer 1: PROV-O {#provo}

The paf.link schema is based on the [**PROV Ontology**](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) (PROV-O). For this reason, the following paragraphs give a short introduction to the PROV Ontology.

The PROV-O, short for the **Provenance Ontology**, is a conceptual framework designed to represent and interchange provenance information. Provenance refers to the metadata that describes the origin, creation, and history of a set of data, providing a way to trace the lineage and authenticity of information.

PROV-O was developed by the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/) (W3C) as a standard for expressing and exchanging provenance information in [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/). PROV-O defines a set of classes, properties, and relationships that enable the representation of provenance information across diverse domains and applications.

## Key Components of PROV-O

Key components of PROV-O include

- **Entities** (things that have identity, such as documents or processes)
- **Activities** (things that occur over a period of time, like processes or events)
- **Agents** (something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place or for the existence of an entity)

It also introduces concepts like generation, usage, and association to capture how entities and activities are related to each other over time.

## PROV-O Categories

PROV-O consists of different categories representing different levels of granularity to describe provenance information:

- **[Starting point terms](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#description-starting-point-terms)** (classes and properties)
- **[Expanded terms](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#description-expanded-terms)** (classes and properties)
- **[Qualified terms](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#description-qualified-terms)** (classes and properties)

## Starting Point Terms

The [starting point terms](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#description-starting-point-terms) including classes and their properties are shown in the following figure:

## Expanded Terms

The [expanded terms](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#description-expanded-terms) introduce some more specific subclasses and properties but also more general properties compared to the starting point terms. In addition, terms that relate entities according to their levels of abstraction are added. Furthermore, additional terms to describe the lifetime of entities and activities are defined.

## Qualified Terms {#QualifiedTerms}

If a relation between entities, activities and actors can not be adequately described with starting point or expanded terms, PROV-O allows the application of a special **qualification pattern** which results in so called [qualified terms](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#description-qualified-terms). This qualification pattern is basically a RDF reification.

## Linking Direction

PROV-O is activity based and all activities have a strong relation to a temporal dimension. In PROV-O, entities, activities and agents are connected **backwards in time**. So items that happen later, link to their predecessors and not vice versa. If it is necessary to have also a forward in time link, PROV-O has some [recommendations](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#inverse-names-table) for these inverse names.
