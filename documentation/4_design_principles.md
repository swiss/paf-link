# Design Principles {#design-principles}

PROV-O is deliberately very open in its design allowing it to be used in a wide variety of application scenarios. The paf.link schema builds upon this open foundation and defines some narrower **design principles** how to use PROV-O to represent public affairs.

These design principles try to strike a balance between on the one hand too much openness which would lead to implementations that differ very much and on the other hand too rigid requirements making it difficult to adapt to the existing realities of different public affairs.

## Public Affairs in General

In its simplest form, public affairs are:

- **activities** undertaken by
- **agents** (person or systems) that use
- **entities** as input information and for generating output information.

## Necessity vs. Convenience

The design principles specify only the **bare necessities** for describing a public affair. In the specific application of paf.link it usually will be advantageous to define some additional links between activities, agents and entities purely for **convenience purposes** (e.g. for easier querying). Using RDF makes it possible to comply to the paf.link schema and at the same time having some additional convenience driven links added to the data.

## Activities

Activities are bound to to **take place at a certain point in time** and can have a **time duration**. They are **executed by agents** that can be single persons or groups of people or technical systems. Activities are **chained in temporal succession** to build an **activity stream** that can also branch and reunite.

## Agents

Agents are used in connection with activities. They are used to show who (or which system) executed a certain activity but are also used to depict further players that are involved. For example in a proposal activity, there is a proposal submitter and a proposal receiver involved.

## Entities

Entities can be used as **input information** for a certain activity or can be created as **output information** representing the **result of a specific activity** (e.g. voting result of a voting activity). Such output information in turn can act as **input information** for later activities. Entities should not act at the same time as input and output entity for the *same* activity.

<figure id="entities">
  <img src="img/entities.svg" alt="Input and Output Entities" />
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Even without generating output entities, the fact that an activity happened can also signal some information: For example an acknowledgment activity means that something is acknowledged even without generating an output entity.

The way how to divide information about the public affair into different entities is with one exception (see [below](#IdentifierEntities)) a matter of judgement. As guideline: If some information added to the entity does not hold true for the whole entity, this is a sign to split the entity into separate entities.

## Identifier Entities {#IdentifierEntities}

A special case of entities are **identifier entities** that represent the identifier of a specific public affair. Such identifier entities should only contain:

- the identifier which should also be part of the URI of such entities and
- an additional class showing the kind of identifier (e.g. identifier of the national parliament).

Every activity that acts upon a specific affair should use the corresponding identifier entity as part of the input entities.

Class **paf:IdentifierEntity** {#IdentifierEntity}

Subclass of prov:Entity. Used with only one property: paf:identifier.

Property **paf:identifier** {#identifier}

The literal containing the identifier of the public affair. This identifier should be part of the URI of the identifier entity.

## System Boundaries

In reality, the paf.link schema will only be used during subparts of the public affair meaning that at some point in time, preexisting information will enter the paf.link realm. This will be done with a **registration activity**. If the information is to leave the paf.link boundary this has to be done by querying the paf.link data according to the needs of the acquiring system.

Class **paf:RegistrationActivity** {#RegistrationActivity}

With help of a paf:RegistrationActivity, the necessary information gets registered within the paf.link system boundaries. This registration activity takes the preexisting information and groups it into the necessary entities that are mapped as output entities of the registration activity (although of course the corresponding information was available long before that and was not *generated* by the registration activity).

## Traceability and Corrections

To ensure **complete traceability**, entities must not be changed or deleted after their creation. If a change/correction is necessary, a new entity must be created. Connecting such entities to their predecessors could be advantageous in terms of convenience but is not a requirement by the paf.link design principles. It has to become clear based on the activities, if something is merely a change of some pre-existing entities. For example, if a registration activity is carried out a second time, this will create another registration entity that replaces the existing one.

## Binomial Activities

Public affairs can come in some form of binomial affairs. One example of such an affair is a proposal and decision activity. The challenge in mapping such activities is the question, how to map the actual proposal, the decision (what was decided upon - does not have to be exactly the same as in the proposal) and the actual result of the decision.

The basic design principle states that the actual proposal is the sum of all input entities to the proposal activity. As they should not be at the same time an output entity of the proposal activity (meaning that the proposal activity would have generated them), all the necessary input entities of the proposal activity had to be generated by other previous activities (e.g. proposal creation activity). So basically this means, a proposal activity should not generate any new entities. One reason for this design decision ist that the actual proposal can be queried easily by only looking for all entities that are input entities for the proposal activity.

If there is a possibility, that the content of the decision differs from the proposal (which is common in political affairs), the decision activity must state what is being decided and how it was actually decided. It does so by using the content of the decision as the sum of all input entities and the result of the decision as newly generated output entity. If there was a change in the content of the decision compared to the proposal, the change of the corresponding entity again must be through a intermediate activity (e.g. decision creation activity) between the proposal and the decision activity.

This principle of using input entities to show an actual proposal or decision applies to other binoms as well.

## View Points

The challenge with public affairs is that they do **look differently depending on the view point** on the affair. To allow for these different perspectives, a `paf:ViewPoint` can be defined that links to all the activities, agents and entities relevant for this specific perspective via `dcterm:hasPart` (no subclass of `prov:used` can be used for this because the range of this predicate has to allow for activities, agents and entities at the same time).

## Examples to the Design Principles

**Basic Affair**

The following example illustrates a very basic affair based on three activities. First a **registration activity** that creates entities for identification and name and description of a public affair. The second activity uses these two entities to form a **proposal** to a deciding body. The last activity is the **decision activity** that creates a decision entity stating the result of the decision. In this case, no proposal entity is created because the proposal is already included in the description entity.

**Extended Affair**

In the following extended affair example, the base entity alone is not enough to form the proposal and therefore, the proposal is built by a separate proposal creation activity. Because an activity can not create and use an entity at the same time, a distinct proposal creation activity besides the actual proposal activity is needed.

## Transformation to JSON and XML

To allow for maximum impact of the paf.link schema, the data should also be available as JSON and XML so that it can be consumed by a vide variety of technical systems. Every RDF serialization (e.g. turtle) can be transformed deterministically and lossless to JSON-LD. The resulting JSON file is quite verbose and probably does not look very familiar to a developer not accustomed to RDF.

**Raw JSON-LD**

The following example shows a raw JSON-LD that was transformed from turtle from [above](#example-design-principles-basic-affair).

</aside>

**Context and Framing**

To mitigate these difficulties concerning verbosity, JSON-LD allows the usage of some embedded context information. Using this information and the framing mechanism, the resulting JSON file looks much more familiar to a "standard" JSON.
