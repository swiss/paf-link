The **paf.link schema** is an RDF ([[[rdf11-concepts]]]) data schema for describing **public affairs** (paf) administered by the public administration. It is based on the [[[prov-o]]] which it extends based on a number of design principles. Using **activities**, **agents** and **entities** as central elements, paf.link schema allows to model public affairs to the full extend. Furthermore, the paf.link schema allows to be adapted to concrete public administrations on different public levels by using an **application profile** (e.g. [ch.paf.link](#ch-paf-link)).

The paf.link schema provides the foundations for implementing public affairs in a wide variety of applications and contexts. In addition, deterministic transformations from RDF to JSON and XML are given to allow this schema to be used also outside the Linked Data sphere.
